 * @par Lifecycle
 * `set_config()` -> `setup(listener)` -> `loop()` repeatedly -> `shutdown()`.
 * The controller is reusable after `shutdown()`: configuration survives, and
 * `set_config()` becomes effective again.
 *
 * @par Threading
 * Carries no internal locking. Run `setup()`, `loop()`, and `shutdown()` on
 * one task. See `espectre_sdk.h` for the full contract, including where
 * listener callbacks land and how to handle controls driven from a transport
 * callback.
 *
 * @par Control calls before setup
 * The setters work before `setup()` and simply update the pending
 * configuration, so a frontend can accept provisioning commands during boot
 * without special-casing the ordering.
