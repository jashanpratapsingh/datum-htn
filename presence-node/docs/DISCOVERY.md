# ESPectre Discovery

This document owns DNS-SD, mDNS, browser bootstrap discovery, and the `/devices` resource. The device API is specified in [API.md](API.md).

## DNS-SD and mDNS

ESPectre uses mDNS and DNS-SD to locate the Direct HTTP endpoint. Every networked frontend publishes `_espectre._tcp.local.` on TCP port `62587`. The stable host name is `espectre-{device_id}.local`; the service instance and display name may use the configured label, but consumers use `device_id` as identity.

A DNS-SD browse starts from the service-type PTR record. Each instance resolves through SRV, TXT, and address records. The host CLI accepts IPv4 A records; an advertisement that resolves only through AAAA is excluded.

| Frontend | Service type | Direct SRV port | Other frontend service |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native | `_espectre._tcp.local.` | `62587` | Optional MQTT |
| ESPHome | `_espectre._tcp.local.` | `62587` | ESPHome native API |
| Matter | `_espectre._tcp.local.` | `62587` | Matter operational and commissioning services |
| Micro | `_espectre._tcp.local.` | `62587` | none |

A manually entered Direct endpoint may specify another port. Clients do not probe legacy ports. ESPHome and Matter keep publishing their upstream service records, but `./espectre devices` browses only `_espectre._tcp.local.`.

### TXT record

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `txtvers` | `1` |
| `protovers` | `1.0` |
| `device_id` | 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters |
| `name` | Effective display name |
| `frontend` | `native`, `esphome`, `matter`, or `micro` |
| `transport` | `http` |
| `path` | `/espectre/v1` |
| `firmware` | Running firmware version |
| `chip` | Active target, such as `esp32c3` |
| `capabilities` | Bounded comma-separated discovery hints |

There is no `events` TXT key. Clients derive resource, `/events`, and `/csi` URLs from `path`, then negotiate the exact surface through `GET /capabilities`. Discovery capability tokens are presentation hints, not authorization or UI feature gates.

`txtvers` versions the TXT key/value schema. `protovers` is the same application version exposed as `capabilities.protocol_version`; it is not an independent Direct version. Unknown TXT keys may be ignored, but an unknown `txtvers` or `protovers` value is incompatible.

The CLI accepts a record only when it has an IPv4 address, a non-zero SRV port, a valid `device_id`, a supported `frontend`, the exact version and transport values above, and `path=/espectre/v1`. `name`, `firmware`, `chip`, and `capabilities` enrich the result but do not identify the device.

### Service lifecycle

Services are available only while the station interface has a usable IPv4 address. A frontend that owns its mDNS responder sends a best-effort goodbye on a clean disconnect and announces again after reconnect or an address change. ESPHome and Matter retain ownership of their responder lifecycle; ESPectre adds or removes only its service.

Native uses `espectre-{device_id}.local` and updates the TXT `name` after a saved label change. ESPHome uses the same stable ESPectre host identity without changing its YAML name, native API identity, or entity IDs. Matter publishes ESPectre only after a fabric has been commissioned; removing the last fabric removes the service and stops Direct HTTP.

## Browser bootstrap

Web pages cannot enumerate DNS-SD services. For each automatic discovery attempt, the portal obtains 96 random bits from Web Crypto, encodes them as 24 lowercase hexadecimal characters, and resolves one fresh host name:

```text
espectre-devices-{nonce}.local
```

A fresh name prevents a cached positive or negative answer from satisfying a later attempt. The static alias `espectre-devices.local` is unsupported, and firmware does not provide a compatibility fallback for a different bootstrap contract.

### Bootstrap DNS behavior

Native, ESPHome, and Matter answer only valid, uncompressed class-IN A or AAAA questions whose owner matches the nonce form. An A answer:

- repeats the queried owner name;
- contains the responder's current station IPv4 address;
- uses a 10-second TTL;
- leaves the cache-flush bit clear so more than one responder can contribute an address; and
- includes an NSEC record whose bitmap declares A but not AAAA.

An AAAA-only question receives the same NSEC assertion and no address. The responder never advertises IPv6. It accepts multicast, QU, and legacy-unicast queries. Multicast replies occupy at most four pending slots, delayed by 25, 50, 75, and 100 ms, and the responder sends at most eight answers per second. Pending replies are discarded after an IPv4 change, Wi-Fi disconnect, or reconfiguration.

The nonce responder is stateless. It does not register, retain, announce, or send a goodbye for the queried name.

### `/devices` scan

After resolving one bootstrap responder, the portal requests `GET /espectre/v1/devices` with the same Origin policy as any Direct request and a 10-second client timeout. Native, ESPHome, and Matter implement this resource.

The request takes no parameters. It starts one asynchronous PTR browse for `_espectre._tcp.local.` with a fixed 3,000 ms query window. A concurrent scan returns HTTP `409` with code `conflict`; a scan that cannot start returns code `unavailable`. Closing the requesting connection prevents later delivery and creates no waiter or persistent peer inventory.

The result schema is:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "elapsed_ms": 3019,
  "status": "complete",
  "truncated": false,
  "rejected_results": 0,
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "0123456789abcdef",
      "instance": "ESPectre 0123456789abcdef",
      "hostname": "espectre-0123456789abcdef",
      "name": "ESPectre C3 abcdef",
      "frontend": "native",
      "dns_sd_schema_version": 1,
      "protocol_version": "1.0",
      "transport": "http",
      "path": "/espectre/v1",
      "firmware": "3.0.0-rc1",
      "chip": "esp32c3",
      "port": 62587,
      "capabilities": ["config", "csi", "monitor"],
      "addresses": ["192.168.1.29"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The top-level fields have these constraints:

| Field | Type and constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | integer equal to `2` |
| `elapsed_ms` | integer from `0` through `10000`; reports the device-side scan duration |
| `status` | `complete` or `timeout`; a timeout may still carry accepted records |
| `truncated` | boolean; true when a device, address, or serialization limit removed output |
| `rejected_results` | non-negative integer counting invalid records and conflicting identities |
| `devices` | array containing at most eight validated device objects |

Each device object uses this schema:

| Field | Type and constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `device_id` | 16-character lowercase hexadecimal string |
| `instance` | printable ASCII string, 1 to 63 characters |
| `hostname` | 1 to 63 letters, digits, `-`, or `_`, without the `.local` suffix |
| `name` | printable ASCII string, 0 to 63 characters |
| `frontend` | `native`, `esphome`, `matter`, or `micro` |
| `dns_sd_schema_version` | integer equal to `1` |
| `protocol_version` | string equal to `1.0` |
| `transport` | string equal to `http` |
| `path` | string equal to `/espectre/v1` |
| `firmware` | printable ASCII string, 1 to 48 characters |
| `chip` | 1 to 16 letters, digits, `-`, or `_` |
| `port` | integer from `1` through `65535` |
| `capabilities` | 1 to 8 unique tokens, each at most 32 characters |
| `addresses` | 1 to 2 validated on-link IPv4 address strings |

The result includes the responding device even when the underlying Espressif query API omits its own advertisement. Devices are deduplicated by `device_id` and sorted lexicographically. Records for one identity and endpoint merge their addresses; records that give one identity conflicting hostnames, frontends, ports, or paths reject that identity. Addresses sort numerically.

Accepted addresses must be IPv4 unicast addresses on the responder's station subnet. Unspecified, network, broadcast, loopback, multicast, and off-link addresses are rejected. The response contains no credentials, configuration secrets, motion events, CSI, or broker details.

### Serialization limits

The comma-separated TXT capability value may contain at most 128 characters. Capability tokens contain only letters, digits, `-`, and `_`; duplicate tokens invalidate the record. The complete result object is limited to 3,584 bytes. Device, address, and output-size limits retain the deterministic leading results and set `truncated`.

## Client validation and fallback

The portal validates the complete result before rendering a device or constructing an endpoint. It remembers only the selected unique address, never the shared bootstrap name or peer list. After selection, the client requests `GET /device` and `GET /capabilities`; the `device_id`, frontend, protocol version, and base path must agree with discovery.

If no eligible responder is reachable, connect with a private device IP, the unique `espectre-{device_id}.local` host name, a remembered endpoint, or Improv Serial. Routed networks, multicast filtering, client isolation, and browser local-network permissions can block discovery without blocking Direct connectivity.
